# Serverless Chat API

## Description
The Serverless Chat API is an AWS serverless application built using .NET 6.0 and DynamoDB. It provides a scalable and efficient chat solution by leveraging the power of AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. This API works in conjunction with the open-source solution "AWS WebSocket Adapter," available at [https://github.com/fehmianac/aws-web-socket-adapter](https://github.com/fehmianac/aws-web-socket-adapter).
